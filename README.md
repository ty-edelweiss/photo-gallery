# Photo Gallery

This project is vary simple. The only single file exsits.

Our goal is to display photos simply and automatically.

## Usage

Just download the single php script from my release page. And then, execute the following command.

To be displayed, your photos should be put together in a directory.
and, this photo collection should be placed on the same directory where the script exists.
Multiple photo collections can be displayed.

After running this program. `cache.bin`, a temporary file, is automatically created for cacheing photos.
